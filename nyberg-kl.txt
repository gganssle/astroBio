EXPERIENCE: Graduate research was completed at The University of Texas at Austin BioHeat Transfer Laboratory where
she investigated human thermoregulation and experimental metabolic testing and control, specifically related to the control of
thermal neutrality in space suits.
NASA EXPERIENCE: Co-op at Johnson Space Center from 1991-1995, working in a variety of areas. She received a patent
for work done in 1991 on Robot Friendly Probe and Socket Assembly. In 1998, on completing her doctorate, she accepted a
position with the Crew and Thermal Systems Division, working as an Environmental Control Systems Engineer.
Selected as a mission specialist by NASA in July 2000, Dr. Nyberg reported for training in August 2000. Following the
completion of two years of training and evaluation, she was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station
Operations branch where she served as Crew Support astronaut for the Expedition 6 crew during their six-month mission
aboard the International Space Station. Dr. Nyberg has since served in the Space Shuttle branch, the Exploration branch, and
as Chief of the Robotics branch. She completed her first spaceflight in 2008 on STS-124, and logged more than 13 days in
space. Dr. Nyberg is currently serving as a flight engineer aboard the station for Expediton 36.
SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE: STS-124 Discovery (May 31 to June 14, 2008) was the 123rd space shuttle flight, and the
26th shuttle flight to the International Space Station. STS-124 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and
docked with the space station on June 2 to deliver the Japanese Experiment Module-Pressurized Module (JEM-PM) and the
Japanese Remote Manipulator System. STS-124 shuttle astronauts delivered the 37-foot (11-meter) Kibo lab, added its
rooftop storage room and conducted three spacewalks to maintain the station and to prime the new Japanese module's robotic
arm for work during nine days docked at the orbiting laboratory. STS-124 also delivered a new station crew member,
Expedition 17 Flight Engineer Greg Chamitoff. He replaced Expedition 16 Flight Engineer Garrett Riesman, who returned to

Earth with the STS-124 crew. The STS-124 mission was completed in 218 orbits, traveling 5,735.643 miles in 13 days, 18
hours, 13 minutes and 7 seconds.
Expedition 35/36 to the International Space Station - On May 28, 2013, Dr. Nyberg launched aboard the Soyuz TMA-09M
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan to the International Space Station along with Russian cosmonaut Fyodor
Yurchikhin and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Luca Parmitano. They are only the second crew ever to dock to the
space station the same day they left Earth. They were welcomed aboard by Expedition 35 Commander Pavel Vinogradov and
Flight Engineers Alexander Misurkin of Roscosmos and NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy.
