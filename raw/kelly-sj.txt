EXPERIENCE: Kelly received his commission from the State University of New York Maritime College in May 1987 and
was designated a naval aviator in July 1989 at Naval Air Station (NAS) in Beeville, Texas. He then reported to Fighter
Squadron 101 at NAS Oceana, Virginia Beach, Virginia, for initial F-14 Tomcat training. Upon completion of this training, he
was assigned to Fighter Squadron 143 and made overseas deployments to the North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea and
Persian Gulf aboard the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69). Kelly was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School
in January 1993 and completed training in June 1994. After graduation, he worked as a test pilot at the Strike Aircraft Test
Squadron, Naval Air Warfare Center, Aircraft Division, Patuxent River, Maryland, flying the F-14 Tomcat and F/A-18 Hornet.
Kelly was the first pilot to fly an F-14 with an experimental digital flight control system installed and performed subsequent
high angle of attack and departure testing. He has logged over 8,000 hours in more than 40 different aircraft and spacecraft
and has over 250 carrier landings. Kelly holds a United States Coast Guard Third Mate’s license. Kelly retired from the U.S.
Navy in June of 2012.
NASA EXPERIENCE: Selected by NASA in April 1996, Kelly reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996.
Following completion of training, he was assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Spacecraft Systems/Operations
branch. A veteran of three space flights, Kelly logged more than 180 days in space on his previous missions. He served as
pilot on STS-103 in 1999 and was the Mission Commander on STS-118 in 2007. Following STS-103, Kelly served as
NASA’s Director of Operations in Star City, Russia. He served as a backup crewmember for ISS Expedition 5 and as the
Astronaut Office Space Station Branch Chief. Kelly also served as a Flight Engineer for ISS Expedition 25 and as the
Commander of ISS Expedition 26. Following his mission he served at the International Space Station Operations Branch Chief
within the Astronaut Office and other technical roles.
Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko launched in March 2015 and are currently aboard the International Space Station for
a one-year mission. Kelly was a Flight Engineer for increments 43 and 44, and the International Space Station Commander for
increments 45 and 46.

SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE: STS-103 (December 19 to December 27, 1999) was an 8-day mission, during which the
crew successfully installed new instruments and upgraded systems on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Enhancing HST
scientific capabilities required three spacewalks (EVAs). The STS-103 mission was accomplished in 120 Earth orbits,
traveling 3.2 million miles in 191 hours and 11 minutes.
STS-118 (August 8 to August 21, 2007) was the 119th space shuttle flight, the 22nd flight to the International Space Station
(ISS), and the 20th flight for Endeavour. During the mission, Endeavour’s crew successfully added another truss segment, a
new gyroscope and an external spare parts platform to the ISS. A new system that enables docked shuttles to draw electrical
power from the station to extend visits to the outpost was successfully activated. A total of four EVAs were performed by
three crewmembers. Endeavour carried approximately 5,000 pounds of equipment and supplies to the station and returned to
Earth with approximately 4,000 pounds of hardware and equipment. Traveling 5.3 million miles in space, the STS-118
mission was completed in 12 days, 17 hours, 55 minutes and 34 seconds.
On October 7, 2010, Kelly launched aboard the Soyuz TMA-M spacecraft to serve a tour of duty on the ISS. He assumed
command of Expedition 26 once the Soyuz TMA-19 undocked on November 24, 2010. After a 159 day stay aboard the ISS,
Commander Kelly and Russian Flight Engineers Alexander Kaleri and Oleg Skripochka safely landed their Soyuz spacecraft
on the Kazakhstan Steppe on March 16, 2011.
Kelly and cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko launched in March 2015 and are currently aboard the International Space Station for
a one-year mission. The goal of the mission is to understand how the human body reacts and adapts to the harsh environment
of space. Data from the expedition will be used to reduce risks to the health of crewmembers as NASA prepares to advance
space travel beyond low Earth orbit. Kelly was a Flight Engineer for increments 43 and 44, and the International Space Station
Commander for increments 45 and 46.
