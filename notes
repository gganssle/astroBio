This file is just random thoughts and placeholders while I work through this project, added stream-of-conciousness.

Data to gather: name, age, married?, how many kids, education degree, education specialty, millitary?, mil rank, pilot? mil/private, hobbies, experience, languages

First aim: extract ages

Ages done, next goals are to extract marital status and plot both of these things w matplotlib or similar.

Okay, now let's try for # and ages of kids. Make a 2D array, dimension 1 = astronaut, dimension 2 = daughters/sons/unknown gender. Then search for key tokens "kid", "child", "son", "daughter", "boy", "girl"

Text number length: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve

I've got the children counts basically sorted. Here's what's left on the list:

education specialty, millitary?, mil rank, pilot? mil/private, hobbies, experience, languages

Next up I'll add in the education fields per degree. Probably best to slice forward from each file's respective degree tag, tokenize, and pull a word or two after the token 'in', as in "Ann Annson has a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Acme University". Then clean in the #fix inconsistencies section. Keep raw strings for analysis in Jupyter. This grabbed a lot of trash too, so I'll reclean in analysis.

Languages should be pretty easy once I build dict, so that's on deck right now.

Military rank is up. Simply raw.find(rank name). 

now i'll search for pilot status

What's left on the list?: hobbies, experience
