<em>Let's see what skills the current NASA astronaut class is missing!</em>

Read the paper with my analysis <a href=https://github.com/gganssle/astroBio/blob/master/results.pdf> here</a>.

This repo contains the Mathematica notebook for scraping and scrubbing the PDF data from the NASA webserver, the raw text data scrubbed from the PDFs, and the Python script for the data analysis.

Once (if) I get to the point where this experiment has discovered some interesting information, I'll publish it @NASA and on the web so that both NASA and astronaut applicants have the deets.
