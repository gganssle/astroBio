EXPERIENCE: Upon completion of the submarine training pipeline Bowen spent three
years attached to USS PARCHE (SSN 683) and completed qualification in Submarines on USS POGY (SSN 647). After
attending the MIT/WHOI Joint Program in Ocean Engineering he reported to USS AUGUSTA (SSN 710) for duty as the
Engineering Officer. During this tour Bowen qualified for command of nuclear powered submarines. In 1997, he reported to
the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in the Office of Plans and Policy and worked on the USSOCOM
Future Concepts Working Group. For 9 months in 1999, Bowen was the Reactor and Propulsion inspector for the Navy's
Submarine Board of Inspection and Survey (INSURV). In May 2000, he became the first Executive Officer of the PreCommissioning Unit VIRGINIA (SSN 774), the first of the new VIRGINIA Class submarines.
NASA EXPERIENCE: Bowen is the first Submarine Officer selected by NASA in July 2000 as a mission specialist. He
reported for training at the Johnson Space Center in August 2000. Following the completion of two years of training and
evaluation, he was initially assigned technical duties in the Astronaut Office Station Operations Branch. A veteran of three
spaceflights, STS-126 in 2008, STS-132 in 2010, and STS-133 in 2011, Bowen has logged a total of 40 days, 10 hours,
4 minutes and 37 seconds in space, including 47 hours and 18 minutes of EVA in 7 spacewalks.

SPACE FLIGHT EXPERIENCE: STS-126 Endeavour (November 14 to November 30, 2008) launched at night from the
Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. It was NASA’s fourth shuttle
flight in 2008 and the 27th shuttle/International Space Station assembly mission. Highlights of the almost 16-day mission
included expanding the living quarters of the space station to eventually house six-member crews by delivering a new
bathroom, kitchenette, two bedrooms, an exercise machine, and a water recycling system. During the mission, Bowen
performed three EVAs (spacewalks). STS-126 also delivered a new resident to the station, replacing Greg Chamitoff,
Expedition 17-18 with Sandy Magnus, Expedition 18. STS-126 returned to Earth after completing 250 orbits in more than 6
million miles.
STS-132 Atlantis (May 14 to May 26, 2010) was the 132nd space shuttle flight, and the 32nd shuttle flight to the
InternationalSpace Station. STS-132 was launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and docked with the space station
on May 16 to deliver an Integrated Cargo Carrier and a Russian-build Mini Research Module. During seven days of docked
operations, three spacewalks were conducted and Bowen logged 14 hours and 34 minutes of EVA time in two spacewalks.
During the first spacewalk, Garrett Reisman and Bowen installed a spare antenna and a stowage platform. On the second
spacewalk, Bowen and Michael Good replaced batteries on the P6 Truss that stores solar energy. On the final spacewalk,
Good and Reisman replaced the last of the P6 Truss batteries and retrieved a power data grapple fixture for installation at a
later date. The STS-132 mission was completed in 186 orbits, traveling 4,879,978 miles in 11 days, 18 hours, 28 minutes and
2 seconds.

STS-133 (February 24 to March 9, 2011), was the 39th and final mission for space shuttle Discovery. During the 13-day
flight, the Discovery crew delivered the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) and the fourth Express Logistics Carrier
(ELC) to the station. The mission’s two space walks assisted in outfitting the truss of the station and completed a variety of
other tasks designed to upgrade station systems. The mission was accomplished in 202 Earth orbits, traveling 5.3 million miles
in 307 hours and 3 minutes.
