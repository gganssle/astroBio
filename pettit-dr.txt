PERSONAL DATA: Born in 1955 in Silverton, Oregon. Married with two children.
EDUCATION: Graduated from Silverton Union High School, Silverton, Oregon, in 1973;
received a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering from Oregon State University in
1978 and a Doctorate in Chemical Engineering from the University of Arizona in 1983.
EXPERIENCE: Staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New
Mexico from 1984 to 1996. Projects included reduced gravity fluid flow and materials
processing experiments onboard the NASA KC-135 airplane, atmospheric spectroscopy on
noctilucent clouds seeded from sounding rockets, fumarole gas sampling from volcanoes and Click photo for downloadable high-res version
problems in detonation physics. He was a member of the Synthesis Group, a presidential
commission lead by Lt. Gen. (Ret.) Tom Stafford tasked with assembling the technology to
return to the Moon and explore Mars (1990) and the Space Station Freedom Redesign Team (1993).
NASA EXPERIENCE: Selected by NASA in April 1996, Dr. Pettit reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. A
veteran of three spaceflights, Dr. Pettit has logged more than 370 days in space and over 13 EVA (spacewalk) hours. He lived
aboard the International Space Station for 5-1/2 months during Expedition 6, was a member of the STS-126 crew, and again lived
aboard the station for 6-1/2 months as part of the Expedition 30/31 crew.
SPACEFLIGHT EXPERIENCE: Expedition 6 (November 23, 2002 to May 3, 2003). Dr. Pettit completed his first spaceflight
as NASA Science Officer aboard the International Space Station with Mission Commander Ken Bowersox, and Flight Engineer
Nikolai Budarin, logging more than 161 days in space. During their mission, the crew performed science experiments while
continuing space station construction. Dr. Pettit and Ken Bowersox performed two EVAs. The Expedition 6 crew launched on
STS-113 Space Shuttle Endeavour expecting to return on STS 114 Space Shuttle Discovery after a 2 ½ month mission. Following
the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster that grounded the Space Shuttle fleet, they returned to Earth after 5 ½ months on Soyuz TMA1, landing in Kazakhstan with a malfunction-caused ballistic entry. This off-nominal entry resulted in the crew being lost for a
number of hours until recovered by ground rescue teams.
STS-126 Endeavour (November 14 to November 30, 2008) launched from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, and due to bad
weather, returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The 16-day mission included expanding the living quarters of the
International Space Station and a regenerative life support system that reclaims potable water from urine. During the mission, Dr.
Pettit operated the robotic arm for four EVAs.
Expedition 30/31 (December 21, 2011 to July 1, 2012) launched to the International Space Station aboard the Soyuz TMA-03M
spacecraft from Kazakhstan. NASA Flight Engineer Don Pettit, Russian Soyuz Commander Oleg Kononenko and European
Space Agency Flight Engineer Andre Kuipers of the Netherlands docked to the station on December 23, 2011. Dr. Pettit did
scientific research and captured the first commercial cargo spacecraft, the SpaceX Dragon D1 using the robotic arm. They
landed in Kazakhstan after 193 days in space.
